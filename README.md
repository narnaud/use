# Use - üöÄ Setting up development environment easily

**Use** is a command line tool to setup environment defined in a json file. The syntax is easy enough to be able to handle setup with multiple environment variables and secondary scripts.

- Append, prepend or set new environment variables,
- Add directory to `PATH`,
- Run external scripts,
- Reuse existing environments,
- Change the terminal tab title based on the environment
- Extend the prompt with the environment name

As we can't change the console environment from a binary, use is using a dual strategy:

- a binary, `use`, to extract all the information for setting up the environment
- a shell script to setup for a given shell, using the output of `use`

## Installation

### Installation via [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (preferred)

Install **use** with [scoop](<https://scoop.sh/>):

```
scoop bucket add narnaud https://github.com/narnaud/scoop-bucket
scoop install use
```

### Or via archive files

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/narnaud/use/releases) page
2. Download the latest `use-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` file
3. Extract the files from it into a directory.

## Set up your shell

### Powershell

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (&use init powershell)
```

### Clink

> [!TIP]
> If you install **use** with scoop, you don't need to do anything, it will install such a script automatically.

You need [clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/) wit Cmd. Create a file at this path %LocalAppData%\clink\use.lua with the following contents:

```cmd
load(io.popen('use init cmd'):read("*a"))()
```

## Usage

Once **use** is initialized in your shell, you can type `use` in your shell to have a list of known nvironment, or `use --help` for the help.

```
Command-line utility to setup environment

Usage: use [NAME] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  init  Prints the shell function used for shell integration
  list  List all environments
  set   Adjust use's settings
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [NAME]  Name of the environment to use

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

**use** is using a yaml configuration file to defines the different environments, see below.

## Configuration

**Use** expect a YAML configuration file in `~/.config/use/useconfig.yaml` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.config\use\useconfig.yaml` on Windows). Here is a small example:

```yaml
# Example environment
example:
  display: Name of the configuration
  use:
    - qt6
    - msvc2022
    - other
    - configuration
    - names
  script: |
    echo "Something"
    echo "Something else"
  set:
    EXAMPLE_VAR: example value
    EXAMPLE_VAR_OTHER: other value
  append:
    EXAMPLE_VAR_APPEND: value appended to EXAMPLE_VAR_APPEND
    EXAMPLE_VAR_OTHER_APPEND: value appended to EXAMPLE_VAR_OTHER_APPEND
  prepend:
    EXAMPLE_VAR_PREPEND: value prepended to EXAMPLE_VAR_PREPEND
    EXAMPLE_VAR_OTHER_PREPEND: value prepended to EXAMPLE_VAR_OTHER_PREPEND
  path:
    - C:\example\path\to\add\to\path
    - C:\example\other\path\to\add\to\path
  go: C:\example\path\to\go\to

# Visual Studio 2022 x64
msvc2022:
  display: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 - x64
  for_cmd:
    script: |
      call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64 > nul
  for_powershell:
    script: |
      & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -SkipAutomaticLocation -Arch amd64 *>$null

# Qt, all versions, using pattern
qt{}:
  display: Qt {} - MSVC - x64
  pattern:
    path: C:\Qt
    regex: "^(\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)$"
  use:
    - msvc2022
  set:
    QTDIR: C:\Qt\{}\msvc2022_64\
  append:
    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: C:\Qt\{}\msvc2022_64\
  path:
    - C:\Qt\{}\msvc2022_64\bin
```

The YAML file is a map of environments, the key being used as the environment name when running the command. For each environment, you can have:

- `display`: string displayed when setting the environment
- `use`: reuse existing environment (they will be setup before)
- `script`: raw lines to call as a script
- `set`: list of environment variables to initialize
- `append`: append values to environment variables
- `prepend`: prepend values to environment variables
- `path`: add paths to the `PATH` environment variable
- `go`: go to a particular directory at the end of the setup
- `pattern`: use pattern matching to create multiple environments with one definition (see below)

### Shell specific values

It is possible to have for some shell some specific values for one environment, for example:

```yaml
msvc2022:
  display: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 - x64
  for_cmd:
    script: |
      call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64 > nul
  for_powershell:
    script: |
      & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Professional\Common7\Tools\Launch-VsDevShell.ps1" -SkipAutomaticLocation -Arch amd64 *>$null
```

For the `msvc2022` environment, the display is shared, but the script is different for cmd and powershell:

- `for_cmd`: values specific to the cmd shell,
- `for_powershell` (or `for_pwsh`): values specific to the powershell shell.

You can change almost everything, except `pttern`:

- `display`, `script` and `go` are replaced,
- `use`, `set`, `append`, `prepend`, `path` are extended.

### Pattern matching

It is possible to define multiple environments in a single definition. This is especially interesting if you have multiple versions of the same lib or app.

For example, here is a definition for Qt on Windows (the `{}` are replaced with the regex capture):

```yaml
qt{}:
  display: Qt {} - MSVC - x64
  pattern:
    path: C:\Qt
    regex: "^(\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+)$"
  use:
    - msvc2022
  set:
    QTDIR: C:\Qt\{}\msvc2022_64\
  append:
    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: C:\Qt\{}\msvc2022_64\
  path:
    - C:\Qt\{}\msvc2022_64\bin
```

The interesting part is the `pattern` key:

- `path`: gives the path to look at
- `regex`: the regex to match files/dirs in the path

So if I have installed for example Qt 5.12.2, Qt 6.5.3 and Qt 6.8.2, I should have those directories under C:\Qt:

```cmd
C:Qt
+- 5.12.2
+- 6.5.3
+- 6.8.2
```

And it will create 3 different environments: `qt5.12.2`, `qt6.5.3` and `qt6.8.2`.

You can use partial key to use an environment. Following on the same example:

- `use qt`: set up the latest Qt version, here Qt 6.8.2
- `use qt6.5`: set up the latest Qt 6.5 version available, here 6.5.3
- `use qt5.12.2`: set up an explicit Qt version

It works the same for the YAML configuration, you can use partial keys:

```yaml
example:
  use:
    - qt6
```

## Shell integration

### Changing the terminal title

By default, **use** is going to change the terminal title using the environment name. You are free to change the settings:

```batch
use set --update-title false
```

Set it to `true` to go back to the default behavior.

### Writing your own integration script

It should be fairly easy to integrate with other shells (contributions are very welcome).
To do that, you need:

1. initialization script (in init directory): integration of use in the Shell, goal is to provide a method `use` that read and execute the output of the `use` executable,
2. shell printer (int `shell` directory): provide the shell specific way to set/append/prepend variables, change the PATH and change the title.

Please check the powershell and clink integration.

## Prompt integration

**Use** can integrate with any existing prompt, as it sets an environment variable `USE_PROMPT` with the name of the environment in use.

### Oh-my-posh

If you are using [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/), add a new segment like that:

```
{
    "type": "text",
    "template": " {{.Env.USE_PROMPT}} "
},
```

### Clink Flex Prompt

If you are using [clink](https://chrisant996.github.io/clink/) and the [clink-flex-prompt](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink-flex-prompt), you can add a segment to the `flexprompt.settings.left_prompt` or `flexprompt.settings.right_prompt` like this:

```
flexprompt.settings.right_prompt = "{env:label=Û±Å§:var=USE_PROMPT:color=black}"
```
